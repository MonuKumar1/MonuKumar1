### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


<!-- **MonuKumar1/MonuKumar1** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->
  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently  a prefinal year student at IIT Guwahati.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning competitive programming and web development.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects that help me to apply my universty knowledge to industry level.
-  I am very interested in learning new tach-stacks and building some real-life projects. The work software engineers do in the real-life, their work-life balance, work culture of different companies are some of the things which always fascinates me. I like listening to other's experiences and working with new people, this gives me some new insights and a  different view to look at the world.  I really enjoy building projects, solving data structures and algorithm's questions, providing robust software solutions and debugging others codes.
